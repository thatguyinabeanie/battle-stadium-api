## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Battle Stadium is designed as an API-first application, with a clear separation between backend and frontend. The backend is a Ruby on Rails API that manages tournaments, users, matches, and more. The frontend (not included here) is a modern React/Next.js app.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Profiles:** Flexible user identities, supporting multiple personas per account.
- **Phases:** Modular tournament stages (Swiss, Single Elimination, etc.).
- **Service Objects:** Encapsulate business logic for maintainability.
- **Authentication:** Clerk integration, secure cookies, and extensible auth utilities.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive RSpec suite, mirroring the app structure.
